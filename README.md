# HeathJournalingApp
Abstract
The health journal app offers two main features: The goal is to allow users to monitor health symptoms, including illnesses, previous X-rays, lab work, and doctor appointments, and facilitate data sharing for research purposes. Compatible with both iOS and Android devices, the app allows users to actively manage their health by maintaining comprehensive records. With user consent, health data is securely stored in cloud-based databases, allowing researchers to analyze and identify patterns within large data sets for diagnostic purposes. Alternatively, if users choose not to share their data, it is stored locally and securely in an individual device database. The app provides users with a convenient way to monitor and manage their health while contributing to valuable research efforts. Whether data is stored locally or in the cloud, users have control over their health information, ensuring privacy and security.
